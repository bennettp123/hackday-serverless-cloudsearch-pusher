The likes of Arsene Wenger, Quique Sanchez Flores and Carlos Carvahal were all considered as Slavisa Jokanovic simply waited for his inevitable sacking. In the end it was Claudio Ranieri who ticked all the boxes, with Khan admitting it\u2019s \u201cpretty evident we are welcoming an extraordinary man to the club.\u201d But for former Fulham favourite Luis Boa Morte, yet again, another role has passed him by without even a phone call. Since retiring in 2013, the 41-year-old has been forced to uproot his family from their beloved London home and start a coaching career back in his native Portugal with third-tier side S.U. Sintrense. And after feeling disappointed and frustrated with the lack of chances in England, Boa Morte is starting to wonder if it has anything to do with the colour of his skin.  INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL NEWS GOALS AND RESULTS: PSG PAIR INJURED, CONTROVERSIAL PEN, LAST-SECOND WINNER \u2018A BAD NIGHT FOR PSG\u2019: SUPERSTAR DUO INJURED IN INTERNATIONAL FRIENDLIES Speaking to SunSport, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been aware of jobs out there, but to get an interview has been hard \u2013 I\u2019ve never even had a phone call. So how hard can you imagine it is to get a job? \u201cIt\u2019s as hard as the chairmen and the CEOs want to make it \u2013 but it\u2019s up to them to change this situation. \u201cThey are worried about the image it may give the club by hiring a black coach. That\u2019s the only reason I can see. Unless I hear differently that\u2019s what I believe. \u201cAre other ethnicities less competent than white people? Are we? I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s about getting the opportunity. \u201cIt comes back to there not being enough ethnic coaches from various continents in the game and it\u2019s true \u2013 there just aren\u2019t enough. \u201cPeople turn around and say: \u2018No, no, there\u2019s this and there\u2019s that\u2019 but this is the reality. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because I would like to live and work in England. I\u2019ve worked there before and loved it but people like me are told they won\u2019t be a success without being given the chance.\u201d  SOCCEROOS NEWS LEGEND TIL THE END: IMAGE THAT CAPTURES CAHILL LEGACY \u2018SOMETHING SPECIAL IS COMING\u2019: ARNOLD\u2019S BOLD ROOS PREDICTION WATCH: TEARS AND TRIBUTES AS LEGEND CAHILL SAYS GOODBYE For all the work done on and off the pitch in the UK, including the introduction of the Rooney rule, the statistics are still damning. Just 7 per cent of the current Prem and Football League managers, and only 2.6 per cent of all the permanent managers in Premier League history, are black or from an ethnic minority background (BAME). And since 2000, 25 per cent of white ex-players have been given a managerial role after retiring. For black players, it is just 10 per cent. In Boa Morte\u2019s case, you can see why he feels slightly hard done by. He arrived in England 20 years ago in the hands of Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, and went on to claim The Double in his first season before making over 200 appearances for Fulham. Brief spells at Southampton, West Ham and Chesterfield cemented his status as a household name in English football before turning his hand to coaching. Committing the last four years to academy football with Fulham and Sporting Lisbon from U13s all the way up to U23s, Boa Morte feels he can do no more. MORE FOOTBALL NEWS AUSSIE BOUND!

UEFA TO FAST-TRACK VAR INTRODUCTION IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE The former Portuguese international said: \u201cFor every Thierry Henry, there is a Sol Campbell. \u201cSol has given so much to British football. He has played in World Cups, European Championships, Champions League finals. \u201cHe has the right presence and attitude. He has the respect of everyone and respects everyone. What else does he need to do to get a job \u2013 or a chance?\u201d Boa Morte added: \u201cIt\u2019s the same being a black player. You\u2019re not going to see him playing differently \u2013 the football is played the same all around the world. There are referees and it is 11v11. \u201cBut people doubt how competent you are. How willing you are to keep fighting and keep your position. \u201cIf I get the chance to be a coach anywhere, I\u2019m going to work my socks off to keep the job. \u201cBut the desire is to have that feeling of pressure. I\u2019ve spent my coaching life working with U18s and U19s but you don\u2019t have that pressure. You then never work out how good you are. \u201cThere are people who would like to just be academy coaches. I\u2019ve done my years of the academy work, but now it\u2019s time to have that role with more pressure. \u201cI need that chance for an interview, because you never get them. People turn you down without even speaking to you to see what your plans are and how you see football.\u201d  \u2018HE PEERS IN MY BEDROOM\u2019: PL STAR ACCUSED OF STALKING EX-WIFE How does he see football? His sources of inspiration reel off the tongue. Alan Curbishley. Gianfranco Zola. Steve Clarke. Avram Grant. Kevin Keen. Dave Jones. Jean Tigana. Christian Damiano. Chris Coleman. Luiz Felipe Scolari. Steve Kean. But after a 30-minute chat, it\u2019s clear Mr. Wenger was the ultimate influencer as he describes one of the problems with the Premier League. \u201cYou need to give the chance for young players to come through and to shine,\u201d Boa Morte says. \u201cThe future is always made from young players. You have to give them good foundations in the academy to be ready when they come through. It has to be like that. \u201cPeople have been working hard on that in England for the last four or five years. Now we need them shining in the Premier League.\u201d He\u2019s done the hard graft. He has the experience. He has the knowledge and the desire to push through youth. All he wants is an interview to show skin colour doesn\u2019t matter. This story originally appeared in The Sun.
